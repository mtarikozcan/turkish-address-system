##  Current System Capabilities

###  WORKING PERFECTLY
```python
# Turkish Character Mastery
"istanbul" → "İstanbul" 
"sisli" → "Şişli"   
"cankaya" → "Çankaya" 

# Abbreviation Expansion  
"mh" → "mahallesi" 
"sk" → "sokak" 
"cd" → "cadde" 

# Complete Address Processing
"istanbul kadikoy moda mh" → 
  il="İstanbul", ilce="Kadıköy", mahalle="Moda"  VALID HIERARCHY

# Spelling Correction
"istbl" → "istanbul" 
"kadikoy" → "kadıköy" 
```

###  TARGET CAPABILITIES (Phase 3.5)
```python
# Standalone Neighborhood Recognition
"istanbul mecidiyekoy" →
  il="İstanbul", ilce="Şişli", mahalle="Mecidiyeköy" 

# Street-Level Parsing
"istanbul kadikoy moda bagdat caddesi 127" →
  il="İstanbul", ilce="Kadıköy", mahalle="Moda", 
  sokak="Bağdat Caddesi", bina_no="127" 

# Complex Address Handling
"ankara cankaya kizilay tunali hilmi caddesi 25/A" →
  Complete component extraction 
```
